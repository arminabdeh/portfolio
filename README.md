## Image Processing Project - LUENN

[LUENN GitHub Repository](https://github.com/arminabdeh/LUENN.git)

### Project Description:

The **LUENN (Localization Under Entangled Neural Networks)** project is an innovative solution to enhance the temporal resolution of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), a powerful technique for visualizing sub-cellular structures. LUENN introduces a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that challenges the isolated emitter assumption, leading to improved accuracy in SMLM.

LUENN is implemented as a Python package using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. This project offers significant benefits across various imaging modalities and frame densities, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. ![paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05542)

### Key Features:

- Deep CNN architecture optimized for SMLM.
- Enhanced temporal resolution for sub-cellular imaging.
- Compatibility with various imaging modalities.
- Open-source and actively maintained.

### Example:

Watch a 3D reconstruction of a live cell achieved using LUENN:
