## Image processing project
### LUENN(link)

The development of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (__SMLM__) has enabled the visualization of sub-cellular structures, but its temporal resolution is limited. To address this issue, a deep-convolutional neural network called __LUENN__ has been introduced, which uses a unique architecture that rejects the isolated emitter assumption. LUENN is a Python package based on a deep CNN that utilizes the [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/) tool for SMLM. It is capable of achieving high accuracy for a wide range of imaging modalities and frame densities. <br>
